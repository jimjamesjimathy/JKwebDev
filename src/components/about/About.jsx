              I am originally from San Marcos, TX, but I currently reside in Cleveland, OH. I have my sights set on moving to Seattle, WA just as soon as I land my first position in tech.

               Outside of the coding world I like to keep busy. I play 5 instruments, write, record and produce my own music. I also have become fond of making comedy skits and doing my best to make people laugh. Everyone I know calls me a dad without kids because of my jokes, and I say that makes me a faux pa ðŸ˜Ž
